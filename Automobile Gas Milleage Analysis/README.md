# Automobile Gas Milleage Analysis

For details, please check the report [HERE](https://github.com/yovalishere/Other/blob/main/Automobile%20Gas%20Milleage%20Analysis/Automobile_Report.pdf)
### Project description
The aim is to predict whether a given car gets high or low mileage with 5
classification models. They are **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, **Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA)**, **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression** and **K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**. 

### Data description
The [Auto MPG dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) is retrieved from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
It originally contains 398 rows and 9 columns. After data cleaning, 392 rows and 8 columns were used in this analysis. 

### Project findings.
QDA performs the best as it gives the lowest testing error.<br><br>
